                            <h3>HTML</h3>
                            <p>My journey in web development began with a humble curiosity about the inner workings of
                                websites. Starting with HTML, I immersed myself in the fundamentals of web markup,
                                gradually mastering the art of structuring and styling content. With each line of code,
                                I discovered new possibilities and honed my skills, progressing from simple static pages
                                to dynamic and interactive experiences. Over time, I embraced CSS for styling and
                                JavaScript for interactivity, expanding my toolkit and deepening my understanding of web
                                development. Today, as a proficient web developer, I look back on my journey with
                                gratitude, proud of how far I've come and excited for the endless possibilities ahead.

                            <div class="year"><i class='bx bxs-calendar'></i> April 2023 - May 2023</div>
                            <h3>CSS</h3>
                            <p>
                                After mastering HTML's structure, I eagerly delved into the world of CSS to add style
                                and personality to my web projects. From learning the basics of selectors and properties
                                to mastering advanced techniques like flexbox and grid layouts, CSS became my creative
                                playground. With each project, I honed my skills in typography, color theory, and
                                responsive design, striving to create visually stunning and user-friendly websites. CSS
                                empowered me to transform static pages into dynamic and engaging experiences, fueling my
                                passion for web development even further.</p>

                            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                            <p>After establishing a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, I eagerly embraced JavaScript to
                                add interactivity and functionality to my web projects. JavaScript opened up a world of
                                dynamic possibilities, allowing me to create engaging user experiences and responsive
                                interfaces. From manipulating the DOM to handling asynchronous operations, I dove deep
                                into JavaScript's core concepts, constantly pushing the boundaries of what I could
                                achieve. With each project, I gained a deeper understanding of concepts like variables,
                                loops, and functions, honing my problem-solving skills along the way. JavaScript became
                                my go-to tool for creating rich and immersive web applications, solidifying my passion
                                for web development.</p>

                            <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
                            <p>Building upon my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I ventured into the realm of
                                UI/UX design to enhance the usability and aesthetics of my web projects. Studying design
                                principles and user experience guidelines, I gained insights into crafting intuitive
                                interfaces that prioritize user needs and enhance engagement. From wireframing and
                                prototyping to conducting usability tests, I embraced the iterative design process,
                                constantly refining my designs based on feedback and usability insights. With a keen eye
                                for detail and a focus on user-centric design, I strive to create seamless and
                                delightful experiences that leave a lasting impression on users.</p>

                            <h3>PHP</h3>
                            <p>
                                Expanding my skill set beyond front-end technologies, I delved into server-side
                                scripting with PHP to add dynamic functionality to my web projects. With PHP, I gained
                                the ability to interact with databases, handle form submissions, and create dynamic
                                content tailored to user input. From building e-commerce platforms to content management
                                systems, PHP became an integral part of my toolkit for developing robust and scalable
                                web applications. Embracing concepts like sessions, cookies, and security best
                                practices, I ensured the reliability and integrity of my PHP-powered websites, further
                                solidifying my expertise in web development.</p>

                            <h3>Next.js</h3>
                            <p>Continuing my journey in web development, I ventured into the world of Next.js, a
                                powerful React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web
                                applications. With Next.js, I harnessed the benefits of React along with features like
                                server-side rendering, routing, and API routes, to create fast, SEO-friendly, and
                                scalable web applications. Leveraging its intuitive development environment and seamless
                                deployment capabilities, I streamlined my workflow and accelerated development cycles.
                                From building dynamic single-page applications to optimizing performance and SEO,
                                Next.js empowered me to tackle complex web development challenges with confidence,
                                further enriching my skill set and expertise.
